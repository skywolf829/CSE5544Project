This work was presented to a domain expert in the fields of design, 3D modeling, and virtual reality. Feedback was overall positive, citing the clear instructions and good contrast between the background and foreground keeping the eyes focused on the visualization, instructions, and user interface. The use of hover effects to show when a user interface item could be selected also was an important feature referenced. Some improvements suggested were related to the visualizations themselves. It was recommended to remove the glass panes around the visualizations, as this can lead to a "museum effect" in which the user gazes from afar and doesn't realize the visualization is intractable. While we find this useful for displaying the minimum and maximum x, y, and z values, we can see how this may be the case.

Another piece of input given from this expert was the movement functionality. The touchpad allows users to navigate around, but this movement is very motion sickness inducing to many virtual reality users. He recommended we remove that completely, or allow it to be toggled, so that users don't accidentally do this. We agree, and think this should be given as a warning to users beforehand.

As a last piece of input, it was suggested that more feedback is given to the user when hovering over intractable objects on the user interface. A brighter glow or haptic feedback will invite the user to interact and know when they have hovered over something intractable.
