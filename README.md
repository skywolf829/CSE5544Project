## Running
Windows
To run the standalone build on Windows, view the "Builds" branch by clicking on "Branch: master" toward the top, and selecting Builds. The ZIP folder with the Windows build is located in the root directory of the project. Please download that, extract the project, and run the executable inside.

## Hardware requirement
For VR, a machine with a strong graphics card is recommended. If VR is not being used, then a laptop or desktop with a moderate CPU and GPU should be able to run this in the VR emulation mode with little difficulty.

VR headsets supported include the Vive, Vive Pro, Oculus Go, and Oculus Rift.
